        Born Cabell Calloway III on December 25, 1907, in Rochester, New York,
        Cab Calloway's charm and vibrancy helped him become a noted singer and
        bandleader. He grew up in Baltimore, Maryland, where he first started
        singing, and where his lifelong love of visiting racetracks took hold. A
        move to Chicago, Illinois, saw Calloway begin to study law at Crane
        College (now Malcolm X College), but his focus always remained on music.

        While performing at Chicago's Sunset Club, Calloway met Louis Armstrong,
        who tutored him in the art of scat singing (using nonsensical sounds to
        improvise melodies). In 1928, Calloway took over the leadership of his
        own band, the Alabamians. Ready for the next step in his career, he
        headed to New York the following year.

        In 1930, Calloway got a gig at Harlem's famed Cotton Club. Soon, as the
        bandleader of Cab Calloway and his Orchestra, he became a regular
        performer at the popular nightspot. Calloway hit the big time with
        "Minnie the Moocher" (1931), a No. 1 song that sold more than one
        million copies. The tune's famous call-and-response "hi-de-hi-de-ho"
        chorus — improvised when he couldn't recall a lyric — became Calloway's
        signature phrase for the rest of his career.
