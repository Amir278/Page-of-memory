        With other hits that included "Moon Glow" (1934), "The Jumpin' Jive"
        (1939) and "Blues in the Night" (1941), as well as appearances on radio,
        Calloway was one of the most successful performers of the era. During
        the 1930s and 1940s, he appeared in such films as The Big Broadcast
        (1932), The Singing Kid (1936) and Stormy Weather (1943). In addition to
        music, Calloway influenced the public with books such as 1944's The New
        Cab Calloway's Hepster's Dictionary: Language of Jive, which offered
        definitions for terms like "in the groove" and "zoot suit."

        Calloway and his orchestra had successful tours in Canada, Europe and
        across the United States, traveling in private train cars when they
        visited the South in order to escape some of the hardships of
        segregation. With his enticing voice, energetic onstage moves and dapper
        white tuxedos, Calloway was the star attraction. However, the group's
        musical talent was just as impressive, partly because the salaries
        Calloway offered were second only to Duke Ellington's. The standout
        musicians Calloway performed with include saxophonist Chu Berry,
        trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and drummer Cozy Cole.

        In 1948, as the public had stopped flocking to big bands, Calloway
        switched to working with a six-member group. Beginning in 1952, he spent
        two years in the cast of a revival of the musical Porgy and Bess. In
        that show, he portrayed Sportin' Life, a character Calloway himself had
        reportedly inspired George Gershwin to create. Calloway took other
        onstage roles over the years, including the male lead in a 1967
        production of Hello Dolly!, whose all-Black cast also featured Pearl
        Bailey.

        Calloway introduced himself to new fans by appearing on Sesame Street
        and in Janet Jackson's 1990 music video for "Alright," and shared his
        life story in an autobiography, Of Minnie the Moocher and Me (1976). He
        also made more big screen appearances, most notably in the 1980 movie
        The Blues Brothers. During the film, Calloway put on his trademark white
        tie and tails and performed "Minnie the Moocher" once again.
