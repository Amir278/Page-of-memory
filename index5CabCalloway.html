      <p>
        Calloway married Zulme "Nuffie" Calloway in the mid 1950s and together
        they made their home in Greenburgh, New York. The couple had one
        daughter, Chris Calloway, who later performed with her father and became
        a respected jazz singer and dancer. Chris died in August 2008 after a
        long battle with breast cancer; a couple months later, Nuffie died at a
        nursing home in Delaware at the age of 93.

        In 1993, President Bill Clinton presented Calloway with a National Medal
        of the Arts. Calloway's later years were spent in White Plains, New
        York, until he had a stroke in June 1994. He then moved to a nursing
        home in Hockessin, Delaware, where he died on November 18, 1994, at the
        age of 86.
