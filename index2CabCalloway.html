        Singer and bandleader Cab Calloway learned the art of scat singing
        before landing a regular gig at Harlem's famous Cotton Club. Following
        the enormous success of his song "Minnie the Moocher" (1931), Calloway
        became one of the most popular entertainers of the 1930s and '40s. He
        appeared on stage and in films before his death in 1994, at age 86.
